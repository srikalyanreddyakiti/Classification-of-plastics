# 🧪 Classification of Plastics

This project focuses on identifying and classifying different types of plastics using **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy** and **Machine Learning Models**. The tool aids in forensic research and environmental studies by analyzing the IR signals of plastic materials and matching them to known samples for accurate classification.
